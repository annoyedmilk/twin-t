# Twin-T Notch Filter Analysis

This repository presents the simulation, measurement, and analysis of a Twin-T Notch Filter. It includes LTSpice simulations, real-world measurements using a PicoScope with the "FRA for PicoScope" addon, and a Python script for data analysis and visualization.

## Prerequisites

- LTSpice for circuit simulation
- PicoScope & "FRA for PicoScope" addon for measurements
- Python for analysis and plotting

## Installation

Clone the repository and install Python dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.annoyedmilk/twin-t.git
cd twin-t
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Analysis and Plotting

- From the project root, execute `python comparison.py` to analyze and visualize the data.
